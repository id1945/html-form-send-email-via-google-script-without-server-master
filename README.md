# Send Email from a *Static* HTML Form using Google Apps Mail!

A ***Step-by-Step Example*** of using an **HTML Form** to send a "Contact Us" Message via Email without a Backend Server using a Google Script - No PHP, Python, Ruby, Java, Node.js etc.

## Why?

We needed a way of sending an email from a "*static*" HTML page
when you don't (*want* to) *have* a *server*.

### *Key Advantages*

+ No "*Backend*" to Deploy/Maintain/Pay for
+ ***Fully Customisabe*** - every aspect is customisable!
+ Email *sent via* ***Google Mail*** which is ***Whitelisted Everywhere*** (*high deliverability success*)
+ **Collect/Store** any **form data** in a ***Spreadsheet*** for easy viewing  
(*perfect if you need to share it with non-technical people*)

## What?

Instead of using a server to send your email,
which is *easy* but requires *maintenance*,  
use Google to send mail on your behalf
and use Google Spreadsheets to keep track of the data!

> You *could* use a "*free*" service like http://formspree.io/ to process your form submissions
if you don't care where you are sending your data and want to manage the data submitted  
in your email inbox (*messy ... yuck*!)  
*Or*... you can *invest* a few minutes and keep data private/manageable.
*Take your pick*.

## *How*?

### 1. Make a Copy of the Sample Spreadsheet

> Sample: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Bn4m6iA_Xch1zzhNvo_6CoQWqOAgwwkOWJKC-phHx2Q/

In Google Sheets, Click "**File**" > "**Make a copy**..."

![1-make-copy](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10559679/d0056a0c-74ee-11e5-9fdc-c12e13684a46.png)

This should give you something like this:

![2-copy-of-sheet](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10559710/3aec92f0-74ef-11e5-9295-f1988a23257b.png)

> Note: Feel free to change the name of the Copy to anything you want,
it will not affect the outcome.

### 2. Open the Script Editor

Open the **Script editor...** by clicking "**Tools**" > "**Script editor...**"

![2 script-editor](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10559732/8db2b9f6-74ef-11e5-8bf2-de286f079929.png)

Here's a *snapshot* of the script you need (*at this point in the exercise*): [google-script-just-email.js](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nelsonic/html-form-send-email-via-google-script-without-server/1d1c6727f69dec64a6b7f6bd6ff0dd72d0374210/google-script-just-email.js)

### 3. Set the `TO_ADDRESS` in the Script

In the editor window you should expect to see:

![3-script-editor-showing-script](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10560379/9efa5b3a-7501-11e5-96ba-a9e3b2d77ee4.png)

Change the value of the `TO_ADDRESS` to which ever email you want to receive
the contact form message.

### 4. Save a *New Version* of your Script

It's not immediately *obvious* but you have to *click* on "*Manage Versions...*"

![19 google-script-no-save-new-version](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10558249/527f3c98-74c1-11e5-8290-5af7fa7f5f75.png)

Then *create* your new version:

![20 google-script-save-new-version](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10558250/53d21d5e-74c1-11e5-88c5-7bc2d8ce6228.png)

### 5. Publish the *Updated* Script as a Web App

![20 a-publish](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10558288/50980aa8-74c2-11e5-8576-72084a564779.png)

Select the *latest* project version to deploy:

![21 deploy-new-version](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10558251/570a5428-74c1-11e5-8ced-5dd26d3de3c4.png)

### 6. Authorize the Script to Send Emails

![5 auth-required](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10560412/89d3fb0c-7502-11e5-81ce-fb239bf545b2.png)

![5-allow-sending-emails](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10560416/a86a26ae-7502-11e5-9add-d5081d409af4.png)

Copy the web app URL to your clip board / note pad.
Then Click "OK".

![22 1-deploy-as-web-app](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10558255/6eec31e2-74c1-11e5-9c07-cea6209526df.png)


### 7. Create your *basic* HTML Form

Using the template in `index.html` in this repo,
create your own html file with the basic form. (*save the file*)

> Remember to change the Form `action` URL to the one you copied in
the previous step:

![7-html-form](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10560470/e2d7fcb6-7503-11e5-9d9a-3771423e51fa.png)

### 8. Open the HTML Form (*page*) in your Browser

Fill in some sample data in the HTML Form:

![html form](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10560494/674b64c4-7504-11e5-801a-b537d276f671.png)

Submit the form. You should see a confirmation that it was sent:
![form sent](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10560501/8f605dd4-7504-11e5-8cd7-06d768beba4d.png)

### 9. Check the email inbox for the address you set

Open the inbox for the email address you set in **Step 3** (*above*)

![email received](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10560512/f87f1652-7504-11e5-8b0f-c342c395a193.png)


> ***Done***. That's it. You just created an HTML form that sends email!

# *Part Two - Make It Look Good* ...

We are going to keep this ***Super Lean*** by using [**PURE CSS**](http://purecss.io/start/)
for our Style (*fix the "ugly" HTML Form in step 8*).
And `submit` the form using [**JQuery** "***AJAX***"](http://api.jquery.com/jquery.ajax/) to keep the person
on your page/site (*avoid "ugly" response page*)

### 10. Submit the Form using **JavaScript** "***AJAX***"

To *prevent* the page from changing to the `JSON` response/result
we need to submit the form using ***AJAX***.

Update your `index.html` to include the following JavaScript file at the *end* of your file
(*before the closing `</body>` tag)

```js
<script data-cfasync="false" type="text/javascript"
src="https://cdn.rawgit.com/dwyl/html-form-send-email-via-google-script-without-server/master/form-submission-handler.js"></script>
```

This will now display a "Thank You" *message* when the form is submitted:

![thankyou message](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10561147/4086a89a-7517-11e5-840d-7f490353e225.png)

Keeps the person on the same page. No refresh.

### 11. Customise the  Message Shown when Form Submitted

Taylor your message by editing the `thankyou_message` div:

![10-customise-the-thankyou-message](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10561213/9e6d3342-7518-11e5-9860-43a268102de2.png)


### 12. Use CSS to Make the Form *Look Good*

For `this` *example* we are using ***Pure CSS***: http://purecss.io/start/
because its ***light weight*** (***4.0KB minified and gzipped***)
and *solves* our current "*problem*": Making it Look Good.

![PureCSS-Logo-Intro](https://github-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/194400/10565838/72d6d52a-75d2-11e5-9b92-ca02b1124920.png)

![PureCSS-module-sizes](https://github-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/194400/10565844/8f4885a0-75d2-11e5-9490-e3fc42c32616.png)

Without spending *too much* time on this, we can make the form *look*
***a lot*** nicer:

![contact form with pure css](https://github-cloud.s3.amazonaws.com/assets/194400/10566392/f38bc454-75dd-11e5-85dd-6819494a98f2.png)

### 13. Make the email look good too!

By default, the sent email's body contains the key-value pairs from the form, with the key as an `<h4>` and the value as a `<div>`. This is a fairly basic, and foolproof view for the data.

You should get something that looks roughly like: 
![Nicely formatted email](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/5610747/22168070/335ad734-df62-11e6-9523-6e193e94151f.png)

> Bear in mind that this is a work in progress and does potentially open you up to getting more than you bargained for in the email. Because the email content is now looping over all the data sent in the form, if a robot or malicious user decides to `POST` more than you've asked for, you'll likely get it in your inbox. Use with caution for now. We're investigating improvements.

You can modify this though, via the script editor. The line: 

```javascript
result += "<h4 style='text-transform: capitalize; margin-bottom: 0'>" + key + "</h4><div>" + obj[key] + "</div>";
```

has all you need. You can adjust the markup to suit you. We chose an `<h4>` because it was the best size for the email, and added the small amount of CSS to it to fix the capitalisation (the keys are all lower case in the JS object) and a bit of default spacing. While inline styles like this are generally bad practice on normal web pages, for email HTML they're about the only reliable way to do CSS!  
We went with a `<div>` for the value part, because it could be anything - single-line, multiline (a `<p>` for example wouldn't cut it).

While we're here, there's also a `replyTo` option for the `sendEmail()` method which is commented out by default: 

```javascript
MailApp.sendEmail({
  to: TO_ADDRESS,
  subject: "Contact form submitted",
  // replyTo: String(mailData.email), // This is optional and reliant on your form actually collecting a field named `email`
  htmlBody: formatMailBody(mailData)
});
```

You can uncomment that if you want to add a reply-to field to your email. The example in the script will set the reply-to as the email submitted in the form.

Google's documentation provides more information about MailApp.sendEmail (for example `cc`/`bcc` etc.) if you're interested: 
https://developers.google.com/apps-script/reference/mail/mail-app 

# *Part Three - Store Submitted Contact Form Data in a Spreadsheet*

Sending the form data directly to your email inbox is a *good*
first step, but we can do better.

### 14. Add the `record_data` Function to your Google Apps Script

![record_data example](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10581613/8b4f9ad4-767b-11e5-90cc-962a9d6acc91.png)

This will record the data received from the `POST` as a *row* in the spreadsheet.  
See: [**google-apps-script.js**](https://github.com/nelsonic/html-form-send-email-via-google-script-without-server/blob/master/google-apps-script.js) for the full code you can *copy-paste*.

### 15. Save a New Version and Re-Publish it

Follow Steps 4, 5 & 6 to save a new version and ***re-publish*** the script.

### 16. Re-Test Submitting the Form

![submit the form](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10582654/cf3081e6-7680-11e5-9fd1-b989a8ba0b65.png)

### 17 Confirm the Data was Inserted into the Spreadsheet

![17-confirm-data-inserted](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/194400/10582676/eb8af5d8-7680-11e5-92bb-30dd08d2d7b3.png)


### _Live_ Server (_on your `localhost`_)

Because we are loading external **.js** files, our web browser
will not _allow_ us to simply open the **index.html** from a
local directory for testing out the form.

Open your terminal and run this command
to _**install** the **node modules** and **start** the **live server**_:

```sh
npm install live-server --save-dev && node_modules/.bin/live-server --port=8000
```

It will take a minute to install,
but once that's done your `live-server` will start up.

That starts a node.js HTTP server on port 8000 
and opens the form you just created in your default browser.
If you wish to update the form styles in **style.css** or the
client-side Javascript in **form-submission-handler.js**,
please be sure to edit **index.html** to load those resources
locally rather than via GitHub.

> **Note**: This is a _light_ taste of Node.js for absolute beginners.
You do **not** need node.js to "deploy" this form, 
you can run it on an **_any_ web server** that serves HTML/CSS/JavaScript.
If you have never used Node.js before, see: http://nodeguide.com/beginner.html
but for the purposes of this exercise (_submitting a form **without** a server_)
you _don't **need**_ node.js or `live-server` 
it's just a _nice_ thing to have when you are creating 
your form because it automatically re-loads the page when you make changes in your text editor!

## Add your own fields!

In response to [Henry Beary's request](https://github.com/dwyl/html-form-send-email-via-google-script-without-server/issues/9)
we made the form handler *generic* which means you can now add any fields you want to the form.

remember to include the fields *inside* the form that has the id `gform`
and ensure that the `name` of the form element matches the new column heading in your spreadsheet.
e.g:
```HTML
<fieldset class="pure-group">
  <label for="color">Favourite Color: </label>
  <input id="color" name="color" placeholder="green" />
</fieldset>
```
This will allow you to capture the person's favourite color:
e.g:
